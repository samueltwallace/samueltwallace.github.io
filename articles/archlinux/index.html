<h1>Arch Linux</h1>

Here is my ongoing experience with Arch Linux.


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation was relatively painless. I knew what I was doing at this point. The one thing that got me was that <code>dhcp</code> was not installed, so when I booted into the live system, I had no internet whatsoever, requiring me to go back into the live environment and troubleshoot. I also had trouble with deciding where to mount the EFI System partition, and my initial mountpoint ended up with grub not finding Arch Linux. Reminder: you should not mount the EFI partition directly onto /boot. Mount it onto /efi or something. </p><br>

<h2>Customization</h2>

I decided to go with a new window manager. I decided I wanted to write my own, as well. I first installed Qtile, found the default behavior unspeakably awful, and decided for XMonad. I don't know Haskell, but I figured out how to set up keybinds and such and got some 'sensible' ones configured. I like pacman, pretty fast and easy to use; not much to say there. I also haven't set up a dotfiles repository yet, but here's a short list of what I have installed:
<ul>
<li> Xorg</li>
<li> Neovim</li>
<li> XMonad</li>
<li> fzf</li>
<li> ripgrep</li>
<li> Neofetch (for that sweet sweet karma)</li>
<li> texlab</li>
<li> tmux (new for me )</li>
<li> Firefox</li>
</ul>

and a couple other odds and ends.
