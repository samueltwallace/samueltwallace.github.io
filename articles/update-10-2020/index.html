<h1>Graduate School has Begun </h1>


I am now about a month and a half into my first semester of my PhD program at <a href="UIC">mscs.uic.edu</a> in applied math, and it's been fun so far, despite the virtual learning. 

For those of you who don't know, I'm more of an applied math and sciences guy. I like math that helps physics and engineering sciences work. That involves a lot of analysis and sometimes geometry, both of which I had exposure to in undergrad. If I had to pick specific interests, it would lie in the realm of continuum mechanics, which means I want to examine the equations that make solid bodies of material move. It include fluid mechanics, how liquids and gases move, and solid mechanics, how solids moves. I wouldn't mind also doing mixed systems, like the mechanics of melting ice.

I also want to include in my research some numerical simulations of work I do. I would like a mix of pen and paper and computer work. I'm not sure what the numerical work will look like yet, but I think it's feasible for me to include it somehow.

My classes are pretty challenging. I'm taking two differential equations classes (one with one independent variable, called ordinary differential equations, and one with more than one independent variable, called partial differential equations) and a functional analysis class. Functional analysis is the branch of math that came from realizing that calculus is like matrix algebra in a lot of ways, but also not in a some ways. So it puts some topology in the mix to help pin down some fundamental ideas for studying calculus from the viewpoint of linear algebra. My partial differential equations class is the second in the sequence, and I haven't taken the first one so I'm a little behind even though I already have some familiarity with the ideas.

I think there is some cool research going on here too. I have done some talking to professors and they are very much respected in their fields. I have talked to some professors and I have had some thoughts about who I might want for an advisor.

<h1>What Else I've been Up To #</h1>


School has taken up a lot of my time, but not all of it. I've bought a couple of books and met a few people (mostly my roommates in Chicago). I try to have something to do other than math.

I've bought two new horror novels, revisited a collection of short horror stories, and bought a totally different book. I bought <b>The Haunting of Hill House</b>, which I liked but don't think I totally understood, and I bought and only started <b>The Cabin at the End of the World</b>. Some of the gore in the second book put me off so I haven't finished it yet. I also bought <b>The Prose Edda</b>, a collection of Norse mythological stories told by an Icelandic chieftain from the 1300s. I'm only partway through it, but enjoy it a ton. I may write more in depth about it later on.

I've also done a fair amount of ricing. I bought a second monitor for my laptop, transforming it into a low-power desktop pretty much. I'm pretty pleased with it, and am also thinking about building a new keyboard around Christmastime. We'll see how the grad school budget pans out then.
