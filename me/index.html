<h2 id="Visiting">Recommended Visiting</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://lobste.rs">Lobsters</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Required Visiting</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://lesswrong.com/codex">Less Wrong's version of the Codex</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Math">Math</h1>

I am currently interested in the following:
<ul>
<li> Partial Differential Equations</li>
<li> Functional Analysis</li>
<li> Variational Problems and Gamma Convergence</li>
</ul>
I started studying these Aug 2020 as I entered grad school. <br>

I have been interested in the following:
<ul>
<li> Differential Geometry</li>
<li> Dynamical systems (Hamiltonian Dynamics)</li>
<li> Lie Theory</li>
</ul>
I did an independent study on Hamiltonian dynamics in my second-to-last semester of undergrad and that was the last time I studied these topics.

<h1>Coding</h1>

I have coded in the following languages (listed in the order I remember them):
<ul>
<li> Java</li>
<li> Python</li>
<li> C</li>
<li> Go</li>
<li> MATLAB</li>
<li> Julia</li>
</ul>
I wouldn't call myself proficient in any particular language; I don't often stick on one language enough to know it very well (which is maybe a flaw in my learning style). I code for fun, (currently) not for work or any paid ventures, or really any ventures other than my own personal use.

<h1 id="Workstation">Workstation and Machines</h1>

I am currently doing everything off of a laptop. It is a Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Series, it is 5 years old, and runs like a charm with some operating system tweaks. I have an HP monitor and a Ducky One Mini 2 Keyboard (though I will be building a new one soon). I dual boot Windows 10 and <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> (the musl version, on a whim). I also have a Kenting writing tablet when I teach. <br>

 <br>

 I also have another machine that serves as a personal server I use on my wireless network for file storage and long-running processes. It is an old laptop of my sister's, a Toshiba Satellite. I currently run a personal archive of (semi-illegally) downloaded paper and textbook PDFs served over Nginx. I am planning on changing operating systems on this machine from the current Void Linux to FreeBSD (for reasons that I will share soon).
