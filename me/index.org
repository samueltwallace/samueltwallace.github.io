* My Recommandations

Here are things I think other people should be exposed to.

** Recommended Reading

[fn:2]"The more civilized a nation, the more conformed its population, until that civilization's last age arrives, when multiplicity wages war with conformity. The former grows ever wilder, ever more dysfunctional in its extremities; whilst the latter seeks to increase its measure of control, until such efforts acquire diabolical tyranny."

* Math

I am currently interested in the following:

- Partial Differential Equations
- Functional Analysis
- Variational Problems and Elasticity

I consider myself laragely an applied mathematician.

* Coding

I have coded in the following languages (listed in the order I remember them):

- Java
- Python
- C
- Go
- MATLAB
- Julia

I wouldn't call myself proficient in any particular language; I don't often stick on one language enough to know it very well (which is a flaw in my learning pattern). I code for fun, and for work (summer internship).

* Workstation, Workflow, and Machines

I currently do everything off two laptops (one for work, one for personal). They are both 5+ years old, and run great. I use an Ergodox keyboard and a Ducky One Mini 2 when I need it. I also have a Kenting writing tablet for the online teaching I did.

On my personal laptop, I use XMonad (though I know very little Haskell) and do text editing in Emacs. On my work machine, I use spectrwm and again Emacs. Both run Arch Linux, and my personal laptop runs Windows as well.
