# Sam's Website

This is my personal website, but it is not just for me.

If you would like to contribute, submit a pull request! I am happy to have suggestions or guest articles.

If you want to simply write the org document, I can run the Emacs command to export to HTML. This saves the headache of resolving too different of export settings.
