<p>This is the personal homepage of Sam Wallace. This is to be a personal and public record of my interests, projects, and thoughts. If I did it, it should show up here. </p><br>

<p> </p><br>

There are several places to go from here. You can take a look at articles I have written, or for more information about me.
